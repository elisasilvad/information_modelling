	<p>Abu Dhabi: Hailed as one of the smartest people on the planet, Yuval Noah Harari has taken the world by storm. The 43-year-old philosopher, thinker, historian and author has written three best-sellers: Sapiens, which examines the entire course of human history, Homo Deus, which speculates on where we might be heading as a post-human species, and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, an exploration of the challenges that confront us at present.</p>
	<p>Harari, a doctorate from Oxford, is a man of unconventional ideas. He thinks big and does so with a clarity that it is at once profound, exciting, and unsettling. In his works, Harari lays out a blueprint â€” that technological innovation and artificial intelligence (AI) are going to accelerate at a pace we have yet to fully comprehend. His solution: Humans need to develop an emotional flexibility that allows for our constant reinvention.</p>
